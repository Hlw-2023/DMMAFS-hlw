# DMMAFS
protein function prediction based on multi-modal multi-attention fusion features
This repository contains script which were used to build and train the DMMAFS model together with the scripts for evaluating the model's performance.

# Dependency
torch 1.10.2 python3.6 cuda

# Content
fine_yune.py:Please use this file to train the sample data
protest.py:Please use this file to test the data
network.py:This file contains the model architecture of the network

# Usage
Input command python3.6 fine_tube.py to run the DMMAFS model
Input command python3.6 protest.py to test the DMMAFS model

# step 1:
